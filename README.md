# PyTorch Program to identify shoes from images

## STEPS
-	Go to https://colab.research.google.com
o	Google provides Colab for free (limited use!)  Be sure you don’t execute code needlessly
-	File | Upload notebook | GitHub
https://github.com/rfox12-edu/image_classifier_pytorch_shoes/blob/main/PyTorch_Image_Classifier_Final.ipynb
-	Pro tip: You can select “View” and “Executed code history” to see what was run (and when)
-	Review the code (you can run the notebook if you want)
-	Add your shoe images
o	On the very left hand side of Colab you can find the “Files” icon to see the directory of files as they exist on the Colab VM.  
o	Be sure to create a directory with your name (spelled exactly the same) under the “shoes / train” and “shoes / valid” directories.  The directory name is used as your image label (so the names of the image files themselves is not important).  
o	Put 15 of your 20 images under “train” and the remaining 5 images of your 20 into “valid”
•	Build the deep learning model (with your shoe images included).  
•	Run the view_classify code on one of your images.
